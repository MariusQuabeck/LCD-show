## use at your own risk, check upstream first.

# How to rotate the display direction

This method only applies to the Raspberry Pi series of display screens, other display screens do not apply.

### Method 1, If the driver is not installed, execute the following command (Raspberry Pi needs to connected to the Internet):

sudo rm -rf LCD-show<br>
git clone https://github.com/goodtft/LCD-show.git<br>
chmod -R 755 LCD-show<br>
cd LCD-show/<br>
sudo ./XXX-show 90<br>

After execution, the driver will be installed. The system will automatically restart, and the display screen will rotate 90 degrees to display and touch normally.<br>
( ' XXX-show ' can be changed to the corresponding driver, and ' 90 ' can be changed to 0, 90, 180 and 270, respectively representing rotation angles of 0 degrees, 90 degrees, 180 degrees, 270 degrees)<br>

### Method 2, If the driver is already installed, execute the following command:

cd LCD-show/<br>
sudo ./rotate.sh 90<br>

After execution, the system will automatically restart, and the display screen will rotate 90 degrees to display and touch normally.<br>
( ' 90 ' can be changed to 0, 90, 180 and 270, respectively representing rotation angles of 0 degrees, 90 degrees, 180 degrees, 270 degrees)<br>
(If the rotate.sh prompt cannot be found, use Method 1 to install the latest drivers)
